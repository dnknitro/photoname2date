NameFix helps keep photos and videos taken on camera organized - it looks for the date and time the photo was taken and then renames the file appropriately:

e.g.: we have the photo image 'P2203.jpg' that was taken on 1 December 2007 1:30pm.
Then the program would rename the file to '2007-12-01 13-30-00.jpg'.

`'P2203.jpg' => '2007-12-01 13-30-00.jpg'`

This is very helpful for me while viewing the photos and uploading them on the online photos sharing service.
I can easily see the date and time while the photo was taken and I like it.
Also while exploring my photos they are sorted by the time they was taken.

Another benefit is appear if you want to view photos taken on different cameras but at comparatively the same time - e.g. at some party :)
If you place the photos into one directory and use the NameFix program to rename them - you would be able to view photos chronologically no matter what names they had previously.

It also renames other files, like videos. But if no EXIF information available it would take file modified date.
